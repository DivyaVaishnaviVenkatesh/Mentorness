## Overview 📖
This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a credit card application will be approved or not. The model is trained using historical data and various features that influence the approval decision.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Applicant's Age
- Income
- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Employment Status

### Files:
- `train_data.csv`: Training data with features and labels.
- `test_data.csv`: Test data for model evaluation.

## Installation 🛠️
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivyaVaishnaviVenkatesh/Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction.git
cd Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage 🚀
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to train the model and make predictions.

```bash
jupyter notebook CreditCardApproval.ipynb
```

## Model 🧠
The model is built using various machine learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results 📈
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, achieving an accuracy of XX%. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
